## Project Description
This project is a fully decentralized blockchain-based Voting DApp deployed on the **Flare Coston2 Testnet**.  
It enables transparent, secure, and tamper-proof digital elections. Users can view the list of candidates, check total votes, and cast votes—ensuring that each wallet can vote only once.

The dApp is built using:
- **Next.js + Wagmi + viem**
- **Flare Coston2 Network**
- **Smart contract interaction hooks**
- **Secure wallet gating & transaction confirmations**

## How It Solves Real Problems
Traditional digital voting systems suffer from centralization, tampering risks, and lack of transparency.  
This blockchain-powered solution addresses these issues through:

### 🛡 Security  
Every vote is recorded on-chain and cannot be altered retroactively.

### 🔎 Transparency  
Anyone can view results on the Flare Explorer or directly in the dApp UI.

### 🔐 Fairness  
Each wallet is allowed a single vote, enforced by smart contract logic.

### 🌎 Decentralization  
No central authority manages or stores votes—removing single points of failure.

### 💡 Use Cases
- Student council elections  
- DAO governance  
- Community polls  
- Transparent organizational voting  
- Prototype for large-scale blockchain voting solutions  

This dApp demonstrates how blockchain technology can deliver trust, fairness, and security to digital voting systems.
